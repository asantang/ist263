        <h4>900 B.C. - 700 B.C.</h4>
        <p>Figures were abstracted to geometric shapes, pieces were adorned with patterns and figures which often told a story. These pieces were used in funerals and rituals to give status to the deceased, and would be buried at grave sites.</p>

        <h4>700 B.C - 530 B.C.</h4>
        <p>Influence from the East led to more naturalistic depictions of the figure as well as the introduction of motifs like Palmette leaves, Griffins, & Sphinx’s. Artists leveraged these foreign techniques to tell their own mythological stories. The Kore and the Kouros, Male and female free standing statues mimicking Egyption pose and proportions, were made to mark graves or were dedicated to Gods.</p>

        <h4>530 B.C. - 480 B.C.</h4>
        <p>The Red figure technique was created and led to many innovations. Proportions of the figures became more natural, and they were able to depict movement and torsion of the body, and because of the black background they were able to convey a greater sense of depth.</p>

        <h4>480 B.C. - 400 B.C.</h4>
        <p>Athens held a majority of Greece’s power, and the money of the city states was used to erect the Acropolis (which includes The Parthenon). The birth of the three orders- architectural styles-were born. A canon of human proportions was invented, which led to the most realistic representations of the figure to date. </p>
