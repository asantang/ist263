        <p>Thank you for taking the time to enjoy my site and learn a bit about Ancient Greek Art & Architecture! I’m a 5th year Design student at Syracuse University who has a passion for Art History (and a Minor in it)! Ever since I was little, I was fascinated by Greek Myths which translated in my obsession with Ancient Greek art!<br> If you’re looking for more to explore, be sure to check out this Video Essay I created about Michelangelo’s Statue of David. This statue comes from the Italian Renaissance, but is heavily influenced by the ideas of beauty that were formed during the classical period of Ancient Greek Art!
