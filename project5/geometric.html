    <h3>Bronze Horse</h3>
    <p>8th Century. B.C.</p>
    <p>This little horse was cast in bronze, and is about 6inches tall and 5 inches long. It served as a votive figure in a Greek sanctuary. Horses were expensive to posess, and thus they became a symbol of wealth and power, which reflected on the owner's grave. The horse’s body has been abstracted to geometric shapes. </p>
