    <h1 class="geometrictitle1">Archaic Black Figure</h1>
    <h4 class="geometrictitle2">700bc - 530 B.C.</h4><br><br><br>
    <p class="geometrictitle3">Influence from the East led to more naturalistic depictions of the figure as well as the introduction of motifs like Palmette leaves, Griffins, & Sphinx’s. Artists leveraged these foreign techniques to tell their own mythological stories. The Kore and the Kouros, Male and female free standing statues mimicking Egyption pose and proportions, were made to mark graves or were dedicated to Gods.</p><br><br>
