            <p>This little horse was cast in bronze, and is about 6inches tall and 5 inches long. It served as a votive figure in a Greek sanctuary. Horses were expensive to posess, and thus they became a symbol of wealth and power, which reflected on the owner's grave. The horse’s body has been abstracted to geometric shapes. </p></div>
