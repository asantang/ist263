    <h1 class="geometrictitle1">Archaic Black Figure</h1>
    <h4 class="geometrictitle2">700bc - 530 B.C.</h4><br><br><br>
    <p class="geometrictitle3">Influence from the East led to more naturalistic depictions of the figure as well as the introduction of motifs like Palmette leaves, Griffins, & Sphinx’s. Artists leveraged these foreign techniques to tell their own mythological stories. The Kore and the Kouros, Male and female free standing statues mimicking Egyption pose and proportions, were made to mark graves or were dedicated to Gods.</p><br><br>

            <p>Created by the famous artist, Exekias. Ajax and Achilles playing a game on the Battle field of Troye. Ajax (right) is tense, which we can see by his eyebrow that is double lined, his spear held tight, and his slightly raised heal.</p></div>

            <p>This Kylix was used for drinking as wine and water mixture out of. As you drink the wine the image is revealed. There are dolphins and grape vines covering the boat and hiding it from pirates, Donysus (the God of Wine) is reclined leisurely. Clearly the vibes are great!</p>

        <div class="achillespenthesileatext"><h3>Exekias Achilles & Penthesilea</h3>
            <p>540 BC -530 B.C.</p>
            <p>Penthesilea is the Queen of the Amazons and the Daughter of Ares. The Amazons are a tribe of female warriors that are famed for their archery. The myth goes that by cutting off a breast, they were able to shoot a bow exceedingly well. The Amazonians fought with the Trojans against the Greeks. In a face off between Achilles and Penthesilea, he falls in love with her as he stabs her. The body is in movement, and we see body weight of her corpse. The proportions aren't quite natural and there is torsion - which is the previlent struggl with having the torso front facing and the legs in profile. There is foreshortening: depicting a long object head on so that it looks compressed- Euphoronios was famous for this. Articulation of joints, veins, and folds in clothing.

            <p>7th Century B.C.</p>
            <p>The dinos was used as a bowl to serve wine and water mixtures in the symposiums (social gatherings for men). The eastern influence can be seen by the Sphinx motifs.</p></div>

        <div class="kourostext"><h3>Kouros</h3>
            <p>590 – 580 B.C.</p>
            <p>This is a marble free standing sculpture in the round. The Kore (female) and Kouros (man) were an image of excellence for men and women to aspire to. The statues were typically commissioned by aristocrats to be used as grave markers. They were offerings to gods in sanctuaries (votive statues). It has extreme frontality - Hieratism- a pose influenced by egyptian art. There are parralel lines throughout the body, from the bilateral symmitry of the body, to the browline echoing the perfect curve of the eyes. This perfection was used intentionally opposed to anatomic accuracy.</p></div>
