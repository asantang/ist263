        Hello! I’m Alex Santangelo! I’m an Industrial & Interaction design student interested in the intersection of design and technology. Over the summer I worked as an intern within IBM consulting as a Ui/Ux designer. I’m interested in gaining a basic understanding of writing code so I can be a better designer and more effectively communicate with developers. In my free time I enjoy going to the movies, trying to keep my house plants alive, having picnics in the park with my friends, and trying to cook, I’m somewhat dreadful hahahaha. I enjoy learning about Greek Mythology, and a book I finished recently that I enjoyed was The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller. I’m nervous about this class, but I’m excited for a new challenge!
